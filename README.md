# Country Stats

I used [the REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to create a hamburger menu UI. The hamburger menu opens and closes an aside, which contains functionality to update HTML by accessing a country's data by name or a random country's data. If a country's data has previously been accessed, it can be accessed again by clicking on its flag in the aside.
